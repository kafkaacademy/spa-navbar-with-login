# spa-navbar-with-login

This repo shows how to make a navbar for SPA (Single Page Applications) without express or other 'router'. 

This repo has 2 branches: 

  branch 'master'  : a simple "navbar" based on an example of w3schools, where we have added a login/logout possibiliy
  branch 'advanced' : a more professional example, to show how the simple navbar can be extended
